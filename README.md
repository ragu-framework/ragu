work at the same product but in different codebase.

## Installation

```shell script
npx ragu-server init my-project
```

## Core principles:

### No artefact integration 📦 ➡️ 📦 
The most common pattern when organization want to share code between teams 
is to create a private npm package and use this package across products. 
One of the main issues of this approach is that every time the shared package 
is updated a new build is required for each application that used the shared package.

### Build system included 🚚
Ragu Server comes with a build system on top of webpack which you can extend
though the ragu server configuration.


### Server side rendering 📄
Ragu server enables SSR by default and exposes an API where you can get
the HTML result from any component. You can write your own Ragu client 
for any language.

### Framework agnostic 🧩
You can write a Ragu Component using any framework you want since they enable you to have the render result as HTML
string (such as [ReactDOMServer.renderToString](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostring)) 
and have a hydration mechanism such as [ReactDOM.hydrate](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate).
